# ProfitFlip â€” One-Pane-of-Glass CI & Automation Strategy

ProfitFlip is a CI-first project built around three uncompromising principles:

1. **Progress is observable inside the repo â€” not in third-party tools.**
2. **Scripts are durable, auditable, and built for reuse.**
3. **The README you are reading is the single source of truth.**

## ðŸ“Š Project Task Log

âœ… = completeâ€ƒðŸ”„ = in progressâ€ƒðŸ›‘ = skipped

| Status | Task |
|--------|------|
| âœ… | Scaffolded Plan B checklist system |
| âœ… | CI job ticks checklist items using `tick-checklist` |
| âœ… | `run-green-flag.sh` enforces buffer and logs failures |
| âœ… | `bash-vault/` created with script + metadata scaffold |
| ðŸ”„ | Finish vault generator (`new-script.sh`) |
| ðŸ”„ | Populate vault with first real script |
| ðŸ”„ | Auto-generate `bash-vault/index.md` with sync-index.js |
| âœ… | Patched failing `demo.vercel.app` smoke test |
| ðŸ›‘ | Dropped GitHub Projects in favor of README tracking |

## ðŸ§  Strategy

We do not use GitHub Issues, Projects, or external tools to track tasks.  
This `README.md` and the CI-verified checklist are the **only sources of truth**.

## ðŸ§© Key Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `plan-b2.yaml` | Backlog source of truth |
| `docs/plan-b2.checklist.md` | CI-driven task checklist |
| `scripts/run-green-flag.sh` | Smoke test + buffer fail logic |
| `bash-vault/` | Reusable script storage with metadata |
| `Makefile` | Task runner: `make new`, `make sync`, `make checklist` |
