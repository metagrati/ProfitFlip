  "pf:reasoning": [
    "Environment Consistency: Ensure the app runs identically across local development, CI, and deployment environments (e.g., Fly.io) by fixing the Node.js/pnpm versions and dependencies.",
    "Dependency Encapsulation: Package specific tool versions and node_modules within the image for reproducibility and isolation from the host system.",
    "Simplified Deployment: Create a single, portable Docker image artifact, streamlining deployment processes within the CI/CD pipeline.",
    "Improved CI Efficiency: Leverage Docker layer caching during `pnpm install` to potentially speed up CI build times.",
    "Alignment with Principles: Supports the project's CI-first approach and focus on durable, reusable artifacts by standardizing the application's runtime environment.",
    "Infrastructure Alignment: Complements the existing use of Docker Compose mentioned for other infrastructure components."
  ],
  "pf:proposedNextStep": "Create a Dockerfile, .dockerignore, and potentially update Makefile/README.md to enable building and running the ProfitFlip application as a Docker container."
